experiences:
    - role: Graduate Research Assistant
      time: September 2020 - May 2021
      company: Auburn University
      details: |
        - Worked on a multi-disciplinary team comprised of software engineers, artificial intelligence researchers, and cybersecurity engineers on continued development of an episodic network emulation tool.
        - Primary work consisted of designing and implementing a secure network for remote login to allow researchers to work from home during COVID-19.
        - During the development of the secure network I also created a few Ansible playbooks to help automate the process of creating users across all the boxes in the network.
        - Additional work consisted of creating a user-friendly web application to generate network and host configuration files that dictates Galaxy how to create its images.
    - role: Incident Response Intern
      time: June 2020 - August 2020
      company: Los Alamos National Laboratory 
      details: |
        - Attended classes covering the fundamentals of malware analysis including static and dynamic analysis, Windows fundamentals, common malware persistence mechanisms, x86 Assembly, anti-reverse engineering techniques, malicious office documents, PDFs, and JavaScript.
        - Attended classes discussing memory forensics fundamentals for primarily Windows systems and used memory analysis tools such as Volatility and the Pmem suite.
        - Attended classes focused on network archeology and learned techniques to decode custom protocols captured during packet analysis, to recognize encrypted traffic.
        - Participated in a mock incident as a responder. I analyzed PCAPs, disk images, and memory dumps for indicators of compromise. I reversed engineered malware samples and identified artifacts that could be used to determine if other computers had been compromised.
    - role: Intern and GRA
      time: May 2019 - May 2020
      company: Oak Ridge National Laboratory
      details: |
        - Developed an efficient and accurate supervised machine learning pipeline to automatically reverse engineer information from frames transmitted over controller area networks.
        - Created an extension of the ACTT framework that used heuristics to classify signal categories on controller area networks.
        - Used a test-driven development software process to ensure risk-free code with all-encompassing test routines.
        - Gave a presentation at the 2019 Summer Student Convivium discussing the progress I made on the ACTT project during my time as an intern.
        - Co-authored a research paper on the ACTT algorithm which is currently under review.
    - role: Graduate Student
      time: August 2019 - Present
      company: Auburn University
      details: |
        - Judas
            - Developed a framework for backdooring 32-bit PE files for a class taught by Dr. Drew Springall.
            - Injects either a “pop-up” message or a reverse shell but can easily be configured to take in arbitrary shellcode.
            - Bypasses modern countermeasures such as address space layout randomization and data execution prevention.
        - PythonIDS
            - Developed an intrusion detection system using Python along with 3 other students for a class taught by Jason Cuneo.
            - Detects the following attacks: NMAP SYN, ACK, and XMAS scans, Ettercap’s ARP poisoning, Metasploit’s ms17_010 psexec, and Responder’s LLMNR and NBT-NS spoofing.
            - Uses Python’s multiprocessing module to increase the scan’s performance
    - role: Undergraduate Research Assistant Student
      time: January 2018 - May 2019
      company: Auburn University
      details: |
        - Performed open-source intelligence research on integrated missile defense systems used by the United States Army.
        - Attended design meetings to build a low power and visibility reconnaissance pod with mesh network capabilities.
        - Performed open-source intelligence research on friendly tracking networks and attempted to find weak points in the existing infrastructure.
    - role: Software Engineering Co-Op
      time: August to December 2016 - May to August 2017

            - Participated in various design meetings to gather requirements for multiple projects on Rheem’s web-based quality management system, Reliance, and developed code for said projects.
            - Rebuilt the Production Part Approval Process (PPAP) application by streamlining the user interface, enhancing user experience while also drastically bringing down the run time and code complexity for reports for this application.
            - Developed a process, that had never been used before at Rheem, to convert old PPAP data into a new form.
            - Developed a script that leveraged multiple SQL queries to generate a monthly summary of supplier metrics which resulted in a 78% decrease in time to compile ratings.
            - Developed a software system that allowed several users to collaboratively edit and approve Service Note documents which prevented said documents from getting lost and allowed all parties to provide input.
            - Streamlined a manual contract management process and provided visibility of contract approval timelines and expiration dates.
        - Reliance System Administrator
